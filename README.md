Errata for Algorithms for Optimization book

* Figure 3.6, page 38: F_2 should be F_3 and F_3 should be F_4 (thanks to Zdeněk Hurák)
* Fig 5.7: change "hypermomentum" in legend to "hypergradient" and change caption to begin: "Hypergradient versions of gradient descent and Nesterov momentum compared on..."
* p. 110: Change "elseif yr > ys" to use \geq
* p. 171: There should be minus signs instead of plus signs before each of the x_i terms under the square root (thanks to Zhengyu Chen)
* p. 449: Eq D.2 should read: 4 * (-27) = -108

## Minor
* Example 4.2: "satisfied" is twice misspelled as "satisifed."
* Sec 4.5: "termination" is misspelled as "terminiation"
* Mu vector prior to Eq 8.18 should be bold.
