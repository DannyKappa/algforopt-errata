Errata for Algorithms for Optimization book

* Figure 3.6, page 38: F_2 should be F_3 and F_3 should be F_4 (thanks to Zdeněk Hurák)
* p. 78: Change eq 5.26 to use s of k+1 rather than s of k. RMSProp uses the most recent value. (thanks to Michael Gobble)
* Fig 5.7: change "hypermomentum" in legend to "hypergradient" and change caption to begin: "Hypergradient versions of gradient descent and Nesterov momentum compared on..."
* p. 110: Change "elseif yr > ys" to use \geq
* p. 160: The ref to eq. 9.8 in the last paragraph should actually be to eq. 9.7. (thanks to Anthony Corso and Joan Creus-Costa)
* p. 171: There should be minus signs instead of plus signs before each of the x_i terms under the square root (thanks to Zhengyu Chen)
* p. 174: Eq 10.20 should have a + instead of a - as the gradients must point in opposite directions and mu is non-negative (thanks to Erez Krimsky)
* p. 176: Stationarity condition should use a + instead of a -
* p. 177: Stationarity condition (eq 10.31) should use + instead of - (thanks to Erez Krimsky)
* p. 449: Eq D.2 should read: 4 * (-27) = -108
* p. 454: Changed two instances of sigma to mu on the left-hand-side of Excercise 8.4.

## Minor
* p. 46: Change Eq 3.14 to use y_min on both sides for consistency
* Example 4.2: "satisfied" is twice misspelled as "satisifed."
* Sec 4.5: "termination" is misspelled as "terminiation"
* Mu vector prior to Eq 8.18 should be bold. 
* p. 201: Changed "positive" to "non-negative" is 2nd-to-last paragraph
